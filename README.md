- **Languages Used:** C++11/14, Erlang, Haskell  

### Learning Outcomes
By completing this module, students will be able to:
1. Select, design, and implement testing strategies appropriate to games development.  
2. Evaluate methods for synchronising concurrent processes and their effects in game execution environments.  
3. Design algorithms that execute on multiple cores or processors.  
4. Develop functional programs and integrate them into digital games.  
5. Apply suitable design patterns in games.

### Indicative Content
- Testing: unit, automated, coverage techniques, test management.  
- Concurrent programming: threads, multicore, GPU programming, APIs (OpenMP, MPI, CUDA).  
- Game programming patterns: case studies and design patterns.  
- Game engine architecture: implementation techniques.  
- Functional programming: process creation, message passing, distributed logic.

## 📂 Repository Structure
```
GamesENGII/
├─ LabNotes/            # Instructor-provided lab handouts (weekly)
├─ LabCodes/            # Instructor reference/starter code (weekly)
├─ studentLabs/         # Each student has their own folder here

```

- **LabNotes/** → Posted by instructor weekly.  
- **LabCodes/** → Reference/starter codes for each Lab. Solutions will be updated at the end of each week.  
- **studentLabs/** → Each student must work *only* in their own folder, named exactly as their registration code.

## 🚀 Student Setup (Option A – HTTPS)

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/oa-SETU/GamesENGII.git
cd GamesENGII
```

### 2. Configure Git identity (one-time)
```bash
git config --global user.name  "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

### 3. Create your personal folder (first lab)
Your folder must be named exactly as your registration code:
```bash
REG="SETU202212"   # This is the example code, replace with your own registration code
mkdir -p "studentLabs/$REG"
```

This folder will hold all your weekly lab submissions.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Weekly Workflow

Each lab week, follow this cycle:

### 1. Sync with main
Always pull the latest course material before starting:
```bash
git checkout main
git pull --rebase
```

### 2. Create a branch for this lab
Use the naming format: `labNN/<REG>`  
Example for Week 1:
```bash
LAB="lab01"
git checkout -b "${LAB}/${REG}"
```

### 3. Create your lab folder & starter files
```bash
mkdir -p "studentLabs/$REG/${LAB}"

# Example C++ starter file
cat > "studentLabs/$REG/${LAB}/main.cpp" << 'CPP'
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, GamesENGII!\n";
    return 0;
}
CPP

# Or Add your files directly from your IDE

# Optional README for the lab
cat > "studentLabs/$REG/${LAB}/README.md" << 'MD'
# Lab01 Submission
- Name: ...
- Registration: ...
- How to build: g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -o app && ./app
MD
```

### 4. Stage and commit
```bash
git add "studentLabs/$REG/${LAB}"
git status    # verify only your folder is staged
git commit -m "${LAB}: submission for ${REG}"
```

### 5. Push your branch
```bash
git push -u origin "${LAB}/${REG}"
```

### 6. Open a Pull Request
- Go to the repo on GitHub.  
- Click **“Compare & pull request.”**  
- Title format: `lab01 – SETU202212`.  
- Ensure only files under your folder are included.  
- Submit. Instructor reviews & merges.

## 🔄 Updating a Submission

If you need to revise work for an open PR:
```bash
# edit your files
git add "studentLabs/$REG/${LAB}"
git commit -m "${LAB}: fix and update"
git push
```
The same PR updates automatically.

---

## 📅 Next Week

Start from `main` and repeat:
```bash
git checkout main
git pull --rebase
LAB="lab02"
git checkout -b "${LAB}/${REG}"
```

---

## ⚠️ Rules & Restrictions
- Work **only inside** `studentLabs/<YOUR_REG>/`.  
- Do **not** edit or delete files in other folders.  
- Do **not** push directly to `main`. Always branch + PR.  
- Each week’s work must be in its own subfolder:
  ```
  studentLabs/<REG>/lab01/
  studentLabs/<REG>/lab02/
  ...
  ```

---

## ⚡ Quick Reference

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/ORG_OR_USER/GamesENGII.git
cd GamesENGII
REG="SETU202212"

# New lab week
git checkout main
git pull --rebase
LAB="lab01"
git checkout -b "${LAB}/${REG}"
mkdir -p studentLabs/$REG/$LAB
echo "int main(){return 0;}" > studentLabs/$REG/$LAB/main.cpp
git add studentLabs/$REG/$LAB
git commit -m "${LAB}: submission for $REG"
git push -u origin "${LAB}/${REG}"
```
Then open a PR on GitHub.
